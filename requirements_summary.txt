* **get**: Sends a GET request to retrieve data.
* **post**: Sends a POST request to submit data.

## Conclusion

In this video, we learned how to use the YouTube transcript API to retrieve and manipulate video transcripts. We also explored how to parse and extract text from HTML documents using BeautifulSoup4, and how to send HTTP requests using Requests.
